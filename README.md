# _Note Tracker_

#### By _**Peter Vang**_

## Technologies Used

* Git
* React
* React Native
* React Expo
* React Stack
* React Navigation
* Ant design expo
* React Native AsyncStorage
* Xcode simulator


## Description

_This is a React Native app build with expo and React Native AsyncStorage. This application is for dog breeders that keeps track of stud clients information or just for note taking._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open your terminal_
* _Clone this project with the following commands $ git clone https://github.com/vangpeter06/Capstone-proposal-
* _Navigate to the directory in terminal $ cd Stud-Tracker_
* _Open project in the command $ code ._
* _Install all the dependency in terminal input npm install_
* _Before running app xcode is recommended and download to use the simulator._
* _For mac user you can download it off appStore and follow the popup for installation_
```
```
_For PC user download VirtualBox here is the site (https://www.virtualbox.org/)_
* After the installation procedure is complete, start the app and select to install Mac OS X Server (x64). Allocate at least 2GB of RAM (4GB+ is recommended) and 30GB+ of hard disk space to your VM.
```
```
_VirtualBox will make all required OS configurations automatically. You should only go to the    Settings menu and change the following:
  * Leave unchecked the “Enable EFI” box in the System tab;
  * Choose two CPUs in the Processor tab;
  * Increase the video memory above 128MB in the Display tab.
```
```
_Then, install macOS and boot your VM._
* _It’s important to remember: when configuring macOS, you should enter a valid Apple ID. This Apple account will be needed for Xcode download later._
* At the final stage of macOS configurations, select the desired resolution and settings in the System Preferences. Once done, installing XCode is simple:
  * In the Dock, find the App Store application icon and click it. Once the app has started, type Xcode in the search field located at the top-right corner.
  * Now, click the Install button below the Xcode icon.
```
```
* _To run app in terminal npm run start_
* _Expo Start Bundler with exp://192.168.68.51:19000_
* _At this time a QR will popup and if you want to scan it with your phone you can also, but Expo Go needs to be download from your appStore on you device._
* _At this point you can press i to launch iOS simulator from xcode._
